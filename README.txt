This super simple script helps me set up a new server block and install an instance of Wordpress on my server at the speed of light.

To use:

Fill out the values at the top of both .sh files
Execute the runme.sh file

That should (hopefully) be it!  

Note:  This was written very quickly and it works for me.  Even though both files are very small, there are likely to be security problems so don't assume this is safe to use.  Also your server configuration may be different to mine so make sure to check that it won't break anything before running!

Any suggestions etc are most welcome!
